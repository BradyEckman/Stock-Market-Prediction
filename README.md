# Stock-Market-Prediction
!!!ATTENTION!!!
You must create a data folder within your project and run create_csvs.py first before running stock_prediction.py"

This program analyzes 10 stock tickers (10 I chose, but  can be changed) and runs them through 3 different strategies (5-day moving average, mean reversion, and Bollinger bands). Once ran through, it saves the data to a json file with returns of each strategy implemented.
